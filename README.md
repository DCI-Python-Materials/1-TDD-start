#   TDD Start

## Objectives 
the participants will learn:
- install pytest
- run basic test
- understand software test concept
- code fix to avoid test failures 

## install pytest
    pip install pytest

## run test command
    python3 -m pytest tests

## code file sum/sum.py
## test file tests/test_sum/test_sum.py

## Task:
why first test failed  but the second passed on test_sum.py file? and how to fix it so tests will pass?

## very important notice:
the code should be written in a way to be testable like break it down into functions instead of writing the code in a big bunch of one unit
